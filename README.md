# Digital Triage Chatbot

## 🌍 Problem

Many people in rural or underserved areas struggle to access doctors. Sometimes they end up in emergency rooms for conditions that could be handled at home or a local clinic.

Our chatbot helps people:

- Describe their symptoms in simple words.
- Understand how urgent their situation is.
- Get guidance on what to do next (self-care, visit clinic, or call emergency services).
- Let doctors review chatbot recommendations if needed.

## 🎯 Goals

- Collect symptoms in natural language (typed or spoken).  
- Assess urgency: mild, moderate, severe, emergency.  
- Provide safe and easy-to-follow guidance.  
- Make it available on web or messaging apps like WhatsApp/SMS.  
- Simple dashboard for doctors to review conversations.

## 💡 How It Works

**User enters symptoms**  
Example: “I have chest pain and trouble breathing.”

**Chatbot analyzes symptoms**  
- Keyword-based detection (like chest pain → emergency).  
- Rule-based logic ensures safety (always escalate serious cases).  

**Chatbot gives guidance**  
- Mild: “Rest, drink water, monitor symptoms.”  
- Moderate: “Consult a clinic or telemedicine within 24 hours.”  
- Emergency: “Call emergency services immediately (108/911).”  

**Clinician review**  
- Doctors can see logs and triage decisions on a simple dashboard.

## 🚀 Sample Cases

- **Mild:** “I have a mild headache.” → “Rest, drink water, monitor symptoms.”  
- **Moderate:** “Fever for 3 days and sore throat.” → “Consult a clinic/telemedicine within 24 hours.”  
- **Emergency:** “Severe chest pain and difficulty breathing.” → “Call emergency services immediately.”  
- **Child in distress:** “My child has high fever and cough.” → “Seek emergency pediatric care immediately.”
